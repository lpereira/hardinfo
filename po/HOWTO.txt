Translators
===========

IF POSSIBLE, run `bash updatepo.sh` in the po/ directory before begining.
This will regenerate hardinfo.pot and update all the .po files.
NOTHING IS LOST if this isn't done, but it prevents wasting time translating
strings that have changed, or are no longer used.

DO NOT use `make pot`!
