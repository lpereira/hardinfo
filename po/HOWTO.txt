Translators
===========

Before starting translation of the words/texts, we have in the program, the po files
needs to updated. This is done by running
cd po            (Always be in the po folder)
./updatepo.sh    (Updates po from source code and shows status)

When done the .po files are ready to be changed, thanx for helping with translation.

You can also see the status of the different languages including your own after
editing - it looks like this:

hardinfo.pot now has 1228 strings (no change), with 69 c-format strings
(as of release-0.5-1527-g39d064f-dirty 39d064f52d54618442e9a056fd6350102360ec6d)
- [ ] de.po : (705 / 1228 remain untranslated, needs work/fuzzy: 2)
- [ ] es.po : (293 / 1228 remain untranslated, needs work/fuzzy: 18)
- [ ] fr.po : (722 / 1228 remain untranslated, needs work/fuzzy: 0)
- [ ] ko.po : (62 / 1228 remain untranslated, needs work/fuzzy: 1)
- [ ] pt_BR.po : (197 / 1228 remain untranslated, needs work/fuzzy: 0)
- [ ] pt.po : (53 / 1228 remain untranslated, needs work/fuzzy: 0)
- [ ] ru.po : (323 / 1228 remain untranslated, needs work/fuzzy: 0)
- [ ] tr.po : (4 / 1228 remain untranslated, needs work/fuzzy: 0)
- [ ] zh_CN.po : (859 / 1228 remain untranslated, needs work/fuzzy: 0)


Editing:
--------
use the poedit program installed by:
apt install poedit
yum install poedit

start the program:
poedit ./xx.po   (xx=LANGUAGE-2LETTER-SMALL-CAPS)
NOTE: only do translation and use find, validate, save in the program


New Language:
-------------
cp NEW.po xx.po  (xx=LANGUAGE-2LETTER-SMALL-CAPS)
emacs ./xx.po    (edit the empty po and change all CHANGE-* accordingly)
./updatepo.sh    (updates the po with all the words/text we have in the program and shows status)
--ready to edit--


Backup and submit
-----------------
git add xx.po    (If you have made a new language translation)
git commit xx.po (Just commit your change to local repo)
git push         (Push it to github)

It is better to make a git push too much than loose all your great work.
