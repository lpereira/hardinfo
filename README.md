HARDINFO
========

HardInfo is a system profiler and benchmark for Linux systems. It is able to
obtain information from both hardware and basic software, and organize it
in a simple to use GUI.

Features include:
- Report generation (in either HTML or plain text)
- Online Benchmarking - compare your machine against other machines

Status
------
- Capabilities: HardInfo currently detects most software and hardware detected by the OS.
- Features: Online database for exchanging benchmark results.
- Development: Currently done by contributors, hwspeedy maintains (Missing OK from previous maintainer!!)

Server code can be found in the "server" branch: https://github.com/hwspeedy/hardinfo/tree/server

Dependencies
------------
- GTK3 >=3.00 or GTK2+ >=2.20 - Prefer **GTK3** (GTK2+: cmake -DHARDINFO_GTK3=0 ..)
- GLib >=2.24
- Zlib
- glib JSON
- Libsoup2.4 >=2.42 or Libsoup-3.0 (EXPERIMENTAL) (LS3: cmake -DHARDINFO_LIBSOUP3=1 ..)

Building and installing
-----------------------
**Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/PopOS**
- sudo apt install git cmake build-essential gettext
- sudo apt install libjson-glib-dev zlib1g-dev libsoup2.4-dev libgtk-3-dev libglib2.0-dev
- git clone https://github.com/hwspeedy/hardinfo
- cd hardinfo
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..
- make package   (Creates package so you do not polute your distro and it can be updated by distro releases)
- sudo apt install ./hardinfo-VERSION-DISTRO-ARCH.deb  (Use reinstall instead of install if already inst.)
- sudo apt install lm-sensors sysbench lsscsi mesa-utils dmidecode udisks2 xdg-utils
- hardinfo

**Fedore/Centos/RedHat/Rocky/Alma/Oracle**
* NOTE: Centos 7 needs epel-release and cmake3 instead of cmake - use cmake3 instead of cmake
- sudo yum install epel-release  (only CentOS 7)
- sudo yum install git cmake gcc gcc-c++ gettext rpmdevtools
- sudo yum install json-glib-devel zlib-devel libsoup-devel gtk3-devel
- git clone https://github.com/hwspeedy/hardinfo
- cd hardinfo
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..
- make package   (Creates package so you do not polute your distro and it can be updated by distro releases)
- sudo yum install ./hardinfo-VERSION-DISTRO-ARCH.rpm  (Use reinstall instead of install if already inst.)
- sudo yum install lm_sensors sysbench lsscsi glx-utils dmidecode udisks2 xdg-utils
- hardinfo

Distro building
---------------
For distribution in the different distros flavours please use the cmake build system with CPack:
- cmake ..       (Add any other defines for your flavour to CMakeLists.txt)
- make package

Please: Submit your changes to CMakeLists.txt so we have an easy to use package for all distributions, thanx.


Setting up addition tools
---------------------------
Most hardware is detected automatically by HardInfo, however, some hardware 
needs manual set up.

- **sysbench**: is needed to run standard sysbench benchmarks
- **udisks2**: is needed to provide NVME++ informations.
- **dmi-decode**: is needed to provide DMI informations.
- **mesa-utils**: is needed to provide opengl and run standard sysbench benchmarks
- **lsscsi**: gives information about hard drives
- **lm-sensors**: If your computer is compatible with lm-sensors module, use by example the
`sensors-detect` program included with the lm-sensors package of Debian based distros, and be sure
to have the detected kernel modules loaded.
- **hddtemp**: To obtain the hard disk drive temperature, be sure to run hddtemp
in daemon mode, using the default port.
- **eeprom module**: must be loaded to display info about your currently installed memory.
Load with `modprobe eeprom` and refresh the module screen.
- **xdg-utils**: xdg_open is used to open your browser for bugs, homepage & links.

Privacy Policy
---------------
When using the Synchronize feature in HardInfo, some information may be stored indefinitely in our servers.

This information is completely anonymous, and is comprised solely from the machine configuration (e.g. CPU manufacturer and model, number of cores, maximum frequency of cores, GPU manufacturer and model, etc.), version of benchmarking tools used, etc. You can opt out by unticking the "Send benchmark results" entry in the Synchronize window.
