HardInfo is a system profiler and benchmark for Linux systems. It is able to
obtain information from both hardware and basic software, and organize them
in a simple to use GUI.

Features include:
- Report generation (in either HTML or plain text)
- Benchmark result synchronization
- Ability to explore the information on remote computers


DEPENDENCIES
------------

Required:
- GTK+ 2.10 (or newer)
- GLib 2.10 (or newer)
- Zlib (for zlib benchmark)

Optional (for synchronization/remote):
- Libsoup 2.24 (or newer)

If having trouble building with libsoup, disable it with:
	cmake -DHARDINFO_NOSYNC=1

If using Debian/Ubuntu or similar, and non-English language
doesn't work, try:
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr


BUILDING
--------

HardInfo previously used a hand-made Makefile and configure scripts, but it
is now using CMake. This makes the job of maintaining HardInfo simpler and
also produces better binaries.

To build, it is recommended to create a build directory and build from
there:

	hardinfo $ mkdir build
	hardinfo $ cd build
	build $ cmake ..
	build $ make

There are some variables that can be changed:

	CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE	Can be either Release or Debug
	[Default: Release]	Debug builds prints messages to console
				and are not recommended for general use
	CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX	Sets the installation prefix.
	[Default: /usr/local]
	HARDINFO_NOSYNC		Disables network synchronization
	[Default: 1]

To set a variable, pass use cmake's -D command-line parameter. For example:

	build $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

SETTING UP
----------

Most things in HardInfo are detected automatically. However, some things
depends on manual set up. They are:

Sensors
-------

lm-sensors: If your computer is compatible with lm-sensors module, use the
"sensors-detect" program included with the lm-sensors package, and be sure
to have the detected kernel modules loaded.

hddtemp: To obtain the hard disk drive temperature, be sure to run hddtemp
in daemon mode, using the default port.
