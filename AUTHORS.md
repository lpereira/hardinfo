HardInfo was started in 2003, by Leandro Pereira, and has received
contributions from many people over the years.

There was a time it didn't even use a version control system. The early
notes and changelogs were lost. Some important contributions were made
by simply submitting bug reports or comments. For these reasons, it
would be difficult to gather the names of all the people that
contributed to the project.
